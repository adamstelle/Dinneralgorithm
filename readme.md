The goal of this algorithm is to use a sorting array to determine what to eat for dinner.

You have a full kitchen stocked with food items in an unordered fashion. You have protein items, vegetable items, and starch items, each with a certain number of calories. The algorithm's job is to help you look through all of the items and determine the ideal meal, which should consist of each food type with the minimum number of calories.
